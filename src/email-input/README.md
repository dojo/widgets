# @dojo/widgets/email-input

Dojo's `EmailInput` widget provides a basic email input widget with validation.

## Features

- Associates an accessible `<label>` with the input if a `label` child is added

### Accessibility Features

If a `label` child is not used, we recommend creating a separate `label` and pointing it at the input's `widgetId` property.

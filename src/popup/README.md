# @dojo/widgets/popup

Dojo's `Popup` widget allows popup content to be shown at an arbitrary position on the page.
The popup can be positioned `above` or below a specific y coordinate. The popup will move the content appropriately if there is not room in the desired position.

A `body` tag is used to render the popup as well as an underlay to ensure that the page cannot be interacted with whilst the popup is visible.

# @dojo/widgets/icon/Icon widget

Dojo 2's `Icon` widget renders an icon.


## Example Usage

*Basic Example*
```typescript
import Icon from '@dojo/widgets/icon/index';
import { w } from '@dojo/widget-core/d';

w(Icon, { type: 'downIcon', });
```

By default the icon will be rendered with `aria-hidden="true"`.
Custom aria attributes can be specified to override the default, and
text for screen readers can be provided via the `altText` property.

*Custom aria attributes Example*
```typescript
import Icon from '@dojo/widgets/icon/index';
import { w } from '@dojo/widget-core/d';

w(Icon, {
	type: 'downIcon',
	aria: {
		hidden: 'false',
		label: 'label'
	}
});
```


*Example with altText*
```typescript
import Icon from '@dojo/widgets/icon/Icon';
import { w } from '@dojo/widget-core/d';

w(Icon, {
	type: 'downIcon',
	altText: 'Go down'
});
```
